The **IOmeter** {% term integration %} fetches data from your [IOmeter](https://iometer.de/produkt/) device, by using the local HTTP API.

IOmeter is a German company that provides the IOmeter device for reading electricity meters.

{% important %}
In order for the IOmeter to be used by Home Assistant, the Core/Bridge firmware version should be at least 62/69.

- Power (W): Active power
- Total energy usage (kWh): How much energy the meter used
- Total energy returned (kWh): How much energy the meter returned to the grid
- Meter number: Electricity meter number
- Pin status: Electricity meter pin status
- Core battery level: Battery level of the IOmeter Core in percent
- Core power status: Battery or USB-C power for the IOmeter Core
- Signal strength WiFi: WiFi connection strength of the Bridge
- Signal strength Core/Bridge: Sub-GHz connection strength between Core and Bridge
